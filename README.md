**Quick 5-Day Weather Project**
Using the OpenWeatherMap API (free to sign up), fetch the 5 day weather forecast for an inputted address. 
The screen should display an input field, an empty state when no address is entered, 
a loading indicator when results are being fetched, 
and the results displayed in a 5 item list. Add some styling with CSS. 

Requirements
- Front-end coded with Javascript/React
- Third Party API requests with fetch or similar library

Extra Credit
- Small local proxy server which sits in the middle of the web app and OpenWeather API

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
